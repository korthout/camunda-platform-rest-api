# Configuration

You can configure the underlying spring-zeebe client using any of the
[Zeebe Client environment variables](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-clients/java-client/#bootstrapping)
and the [additional configuration options](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/spring-zeebe#additional-configuration-options)
offered by spring-zeebe.

## Next steps

- explore the [API docs](/docs/api)
- play around with the API in Swagger UI (running at [/swagger-ui](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html/)).
