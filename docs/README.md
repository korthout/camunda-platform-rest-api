This is the documentation of Camunda Platform REST API.

### Getting Started

```
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

This command installs the necessary dependencies to your local `node_modules`.
You need these to be able to run any of the other commands.

### Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
